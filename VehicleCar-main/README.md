Original Requirements: 

- Create a C# console application. Upon running the application, it should display the message "Welcome to your new job!" to the user.
- Create a class called `Employee`. The class should have three properties:
    - Name (string)
    - Birthday (datetime)
    - Salary (decimal)
- Ask the user to enter their name, birthday and Salary.
- Create a new object of type `Employee`. Store the user's inputted information into the new object.
- Write out to the user the following message: "Welcome to the company, <name>! Your salary is <salary> and your birthday is <birthday>." Obviously, replace the tokens with the user-supplied values.
- BONUS: After the above message, write out to the user how many days it will be until their next birthday. "Your birthday will be in <number> days!"
- BONUS 2: Add a unit test to the `Employee` class.
